# Flagsmith Quick Start Guide

Let's get up and running in 5 minutes. We're going to run through the following steps:

1. Create an account on [Flagsmith.com](https://flagsmith.com/) and add your first Flag.
2. Import our Javascript SDK into your web page.
3. Connect to our API and get your flags.
4. Update your application based on the flag value.

## 1. Create an account with Flagsmith

To get up and running quickly, we're going to use the hosted service at flagsmith.com, but you can easily run the
[platform locally via Docker](deployment/docker.md).
