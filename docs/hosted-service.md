# Hosted Service

If you would rather skip the hosting and jump straight to integrating Flagsmith with your own application, you can use [https://flagsmith.com/](https://flagsmith.com/) right now.

We have [paid plans with pricing to suit both startups and enterprise customers alike](https://flagsmith.com/pricing).

We are hosted in a fully redundant architecture within AWS, and [really care about our uptime](https://flagsmith.statuspage.io/).

If you want to discuss hosting options, [please get in touch](mailto:support@flagsmith.com).
