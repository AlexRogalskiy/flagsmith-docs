# System Administration

## User Roles

There are currently 2 different role type available when managing the application.

We will be rolling out fine grained user permissions in a future release.

### Admin Role

The Admin Role can perform all actions within the application, including the management of users who have access to the Bullet Train administrative console.

### Standard User

The Standard User can perform all actions within the application, but they *cannot* manage users within the Bullet Train administrative console.
