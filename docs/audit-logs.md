# Audit Logs

Every action taken within the Flagsmith adminstration application is tracked and logged.
This allows you to easily retrace the events and values that flags, identities and segments have taken over time.

You can view the Audit Log within the Flagsmith application, and filter it in order to find the information you are after.

You can also stream your Audit Logs into your own infrastructure using [Audit Log Webhooks](/system-administration/#audit-log-webhooks).
