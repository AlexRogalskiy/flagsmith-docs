## Welcome to Bullet Train

Bullet Train consist of 3 components:

1. The Server-Side REST API.
2. The Front End Administration Web Interface.
3. Client Libraries.

To get up and running, you can either use [https://bullet-train.io/](https://bullet-train.io/) for 1 and 2 above, or you can self host the API and Front End. This guide will get you set up self-hosting 1 and 2. Once you have these components up and running, you can add the client libraries to your apps and start managing your features remotely.
