You can integrate Flagsmith with RudderStack. Send your Identity flag states into RudderStack for further downstream
analysis.

## Integration Setup

1. Get the RudderStack API key for your RudderStack project. Add an _HTTP API_ source, and make a note of the
   `Write Key`.
2. Make a note of the RudderStack _Data Plane URL_.
3. Go to your Flagsmith project, and click Integrations. Add the RudderStack Integration.
4. Paste the `Write Key` from step 1 into the API Key field in Flagsmith. Select the Flagsmith Environment that you want
   to send events from. Then hit Save.
5. All API calls generated by the Flagsmith SDK to the `Get Identity Flags` endpoint will send the a full set of flag
   evaluations for that particular user to RudderStack.
