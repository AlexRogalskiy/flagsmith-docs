# ![Flagsmith Documentation](/img/banner-logo-dark.png)

[Flagsmith](https://flagsmith.com/) lets you manage features across web, mobile and server side applications. Flagsmith
is Open Source. Host yourself or let us take care of the hosting.

The application consist of 3 components:

1. [Server-Side REST API](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main/api).
2. [Front End Administration Web Interface](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main/frontend).
3. [Client Libraries](/#client-libraries).

To get up and running, you can either use [https://flagsmith.com/](https://flagsmith.com/) for 1 and 2 above, or you can
self host the API and Front End. Once you have these components up and running, you can add the client libraries to your
apps and start managing your features remotely.
